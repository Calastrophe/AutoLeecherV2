# AutoLeecher
Have you ever wanted to leech off LSF, but not actually work for it? Well, this makes it where all you have to do is run this and then drag the videos into YouTube Upload.

You need to have youtube-dl and you need to shove your client_json from the Google API into the folder...
I should mention expect to hit the queries limit after a few uses, you will need to pay for more queries from Google.
I'm not invested enough to figure out why it takes 300+ queries...
